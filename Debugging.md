# Introduction #
Some times it is better one time to see than thousand times to read or hear about some thing. During implementing and testing of your automation scripts it can be necessary to investigate behaviour of Notepad++ or scripts. In such cases a powerful debugger is a very nice tool. Since jN 2.0.100 it is possible to debug your scripts in every tool that can attach to MS Script Engine.


# Details #
Today I know only two possibilities to debug scripts runing in Notepad++.
  * [Windows Script Debugger](http://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=1757) (simple)
  * MS Visual Studio (powerful)

# MS Visual Studio #
Since MS Visual Studio 2013 the [express editions](http://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=40787) also support this functionality.
